Linked are summaries I have written up of papers I have read! Not only is this a useful exercise for my own understanding, but perhaps these could help people find and dissect interesting work. These were done in [Notion](https://www.notion.com/). 

## In Progress
- Goldwasser, S., Kalai, A. T., Kalai, Y., & Montasser, O. (2020). [Beyond perturbations: Learning guarantees with arbitrary adversarial test examples](https://nonchalant-walkover-b77.notion.site/Beyond-Perturbations-Learning-Guarantees-with-Arbitrary-Adversarial-Test-Examples-1699b9db4ff180e9a719e872ef116f84?pvs=4). Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33, 15859-15870.
