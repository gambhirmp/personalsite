Hello person who has stumbled upon - or perhaps actively searched for - my personal website! I'm Maya and I am a junior at UPenn in the brand new [Artificial Intelligence major](https://ai.seas.upenn.edu/). I am looking to pursue a career in (machine learning) research and will be applying to CS PhD programs in <u>Fall 2025</u>!

## <span style="color: rgb(227,5,173); font-size: 25px;">Research Interests</span>
My primary research interests lie in machine learning theory, particularly fairness, uncertainty quantification, and distribution shift. I am excited by the potential for these areas to make AI systems more reliable, ethical, and aligned with human values.

## <span style="color: rgb(227,5,173); font-size: 25px;">Non-Academic Interests</span>

My main extra-academia passions are in the performing arts! I'm the president of Penn's first and only comedy a capella group, [Penn Six](https://www.instagram.com/pennsixacapella/) (or Pennsylvania Six Five-Thousand). One of my greatest joys is to write and perform both a capella arrangements and comedy skits with these beautiful people. I am also an intermittent beginner guitar player, and an avid (and passionate) singer of musical theater soundtracks in my car.
