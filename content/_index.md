# <span style="color: rgb(227,5,173);">About Me!</span>

I am a junior at UPenn studying AI and looking to pursue a career in research. I will be applying to CS Phd programs in <u>Fall 2025</u>! My main research interests are in machine learning theory, notably fairness, uncertainty quantification and working under distribution shift.
