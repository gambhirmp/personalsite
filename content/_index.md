# About Me!

Welcome to my personal website! I'm Maya and I am a senior at UPenn in the [Artificial Intelligence major](https://ai.seas.upenn.edu/). I am currently applying to CS PhD programs for Fall 2026.

I aim to identify and solve research problems that combine the practical qualitative and social considerations of policymakers with mathematically and technically grounded evaluations from computer science.

# Current and Past Work

Currently, I am working my undergraduate thesis with [Bailey Flanigan](https://sites.google.com/mit.edu/bailey-flanigan/home) and [Surbhi Goel](https://www.surbhigoel.com/), generating synthetic data for evaluating sorition algorithms. 

Previously, I worked with [Bailey Flanigan](https://sites.google.com/mit.edu/bailey-flanigan/home) and [Aaron Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/) on a minmax optimization algorithm for creating robust and represenative democratic decision making panels. You can read the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16897). Prior to that, I led a project involved using conformal prediction methods to get factuality guarantees on LLM outputs to mathematical reasoning problems. I worked with faculty [Surbhi Goel](https://www.surbhigoel.com/) and [Aaron Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/). You can read the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17126).

# Non-Academic Interests

My main extra-academia passions are in the performing arts! I'm the president of Penn's first and only comedy a capella group, [Penn Six](https://www.instagram.com/pennsixacapella/) (or Pennsylvania Six Five-Thousand). One of my greatest joys is to write and perform both a capella arrangements and comedy skits with these beautiful people. I am also an intermittent beginner guitar player, and a frequent (and passionate) singer of musical theater soundtracks in my car and elsewhere.
