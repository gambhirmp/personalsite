# <span style="color: rgb(227,5,173); font-size: 32px;">About Me!</span>

Hello person who has stumbled upon - or perhaps actively searched for - my personal website! I'm Maya and I am a junior at UPenn in the brand new [Artificial Intelligence major](https://ai.seas.upenn.edu/). I am looking to pursue a career in (machine learning) research, am actively seeking <u>research internships</u> for this summer and will be applying to CS PhD programs in <u>Fall 2025</u>.

## <span style="color: rgb(227,5,173); font-size: 25px;">Current Work</span>

My most recent project involved using conformal prediction methods to get factuality guarantees on LLM outputs to mathematical reasoning problems, which was inspired by a paper from [Mohri and Hashimoto](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10978). This paper filtered subsets of language model outputs using a calibrated threshold of a heuristic confidence score, and employed graphical representations of reasoning paths to ensure outputs were coherent as well as factual. We presented this work at the Stastisical Frontiers of Large Language Models workshop @ NeurIps 2024 (my first conference!).

I also recently looked into applying conformal prediction to neural network extensions of monte-carlo image denoising and using causal inference to represent bias in word embeddings as final projects for [CIS 6200](https://uncertaintyclass.com/) (Aaron Roth) and [CIS 6250](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/teaching/CIS625/) (Michael Kearns), formal writeups forthcoming.

As I look to possible next projects I am interested in pursuing questions surrounding distribution shift, and unconvering what guarantees are possible in such a setup, as well as general questions of uncertainty quantification and fairness!

## <span style="color: rgb(227,5,173); font-size: 25px;">Non-Academic Interests</span>

My main extra-academia passions are in the performing arts! I'm the president of Penn's first and only comedy a capella group, [Penn Six](https://www.instagram.com/pennsixacapella/) (or Pennsylvania Six Five-Thousand). One of my greatest joys is to write and perform both a capella arrangements and comedy skits with these beautiful people. I am also an intermittent beginner guitar player, and a frequent (and passionate) singer of musical theater soundtracks in my car and elsewhere.
