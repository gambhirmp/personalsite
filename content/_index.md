Hello person who has stumbled upon - or perhaps actively searched for - my personal website! I'm Maya and I am a senior at UPenn in the brand new [Artificial Intelligence major](https://ai.seas.upenn.edu/). I am looking to pursue a career in theoretical CS research and will be applying to CS PhD programs in <u>Fall 2025</u>.

My research interests are focused in social choice, algorithmic game theory and their applications learning theory, democratic decision making and fair resource allocation.

Currently, I am working with [Bailey Flanigan](https://sites.google.com/mit.edu/bailey-flanigan/home) (MIT) and [Aaron Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/) (UPenn) on a minmax optimization algorithm for creating robust and represenative democratic decision making panels.

My last  project involved using conformal prediction methods to get factuality guarantees on LLM outputs to mathematical reasoning problems, which was inspired by a paper from [Mohri and Hashimoto](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10978). This paper filtered subsets of language model outputs using a calibrated threshold of a heuristic confidence score, and employed graphical representations of reasoning paths to ensure outputs were coherent as well as factual. We presented this work at the **Stastisical Frontiers of Large Language Models workshop @ NeurIps 2024** (my first conference!) and it has been accepted to **ICLR 2025**.

## <span style="color: rgb(227,5,173); font-size: 25px;">Non-Academic Interests</span>

My main extra-academia passions are in the performing arts! I'm the president of Penn's first and only comedy a capella group, [Penn Six](https://www.instagram.com/pennsixacapella/) (or Pennsylvania Six Five-Thousand). One of my greatest joys is to write and perform both a capella arrangements and comedy skits with these beautiful people. I am also an intermittent beginner guitar player, and a frequent (and passionate) singer of musical theater soundtracks in my car and elsewhere.
